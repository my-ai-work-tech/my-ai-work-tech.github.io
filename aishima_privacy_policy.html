Part 2: Privacy Details for WhatsApp App Creation (Meta Compliance)
If you are building an app that integrates with the WhatsApp Business API or creates a WhatsApp Chatbot using the Meta for Developers platform, strict privacy standards apply. Meta reviews your privacy policy before approving your app.

Here are the specific details you must include to pass the "App Review":

1. Mandatory Policy Requirements
To get your app approved by Meta, your Privacy Policy URL must be live, publicly accessible, and contain:

Explicit Mention of Data Processing: You must clearly state that you are processing user messages and phone numbers.

Data Retention: You must specify how long you keep the chat logs or customer phone numbers.

Opt-In Consent: WhatsApp strictly enforces that you cannot message users without their consent. Your policy should reference that you only contact users who have opted in.</p>
